# About This Project

This is a mock implementation of a mini crossword puzzle, as 
presented in my conference talk "Prototyping With Jetpack Compose."

This illustrates the step-by-step of building a crossword square, 
the various elements therein (like a cell number or user-entered answer),
and then the board.

Finally we add an option to check the board and use an Android View 
keyboard to demonstrate how we can mix and match old style Views with 
Compose.
